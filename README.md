# Learning-Materials
A curated list of resources related, we found useful and we wanted to share with everybody.

# Background
Being members of a team supporting GCP and discussing everyday about new, old & upcoming technologies we were always sharing between each other content and resources. After a while, we realised that it could be better to collect everything into a github repository and offer it publicly in order to share our resources and our recommendations with everybody.
